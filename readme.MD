# ReservationAtelierMediationNumerique

A simple web application for booking time slots at digital mediation workshops.

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal is to create a straightforward booking system. Users scan a QR code to access a web page where they can reserve an available time slot ("atelier"). A staff member, acting as an administrator, can log into a dashboard to add or remove these time slots.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **QR Code Access:** Users can instantly access the booking page with a simple scan.
-   **Simple Booking:** The reservation process is designed to be quick and easy.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** A secure area for staff to manage the schedule.
-   **Dynamic Schedule:** Admins can add or remove available hours as needed.

### Admin Flow
